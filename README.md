Due to the rapid rise in number of brands and companies in different segments like food, automobiles, clothing, retail etc., it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify and correctly associate a product with its brand.  This project- Brand Detector, helps in recognizing brands associated with the object concerned, be it - cars, T-shirts, Food items etc. so that the consumer identifies the brand.<br />

Brands or trademarks have a great role in todayâ€™s marketing world. Companies, products, and various gaming leagues are  recognized by their individual logos. Brand recognition in images is the main problem in a wide array of applications, like copyright infringement detection, vehicle branch detection for intelligent traffic-monitoring systems, placing contextual advertisements contextually, augmented reality etc. The brand detector addresses the need to identify brands in images with the help of Computer Vision. When an image containing an object whose brand is to be identified is uploaded, the brand detector identifies and displays the brand to the user along with the confidence level, thereby helping users ascertain the brand and further associate with it.<br />

  The node modules for this project contain the Azure dependencies as well. But, owing to the huge size of the node modules, I have not uploaded them on Github.
  Just to provide a sample of the Azure dependenices in the node modules of the code, kindly check the cognitiveservices-computervision folder <br/>
